# Trick
这是一个用C++编写的简单的exe整蛊程序，在电脑上打开后会自动计时30秒，之后会将电脑强制关机。只有输入一些特定字符后才能取消。本来设计的是第一次启动后会将程序复制一份到系统的开机启动文件夹，这样每次开机就会自动运行程序了，但不知为什么这招只在我的电脑上有效:(

This is a simple exe trick program written in C++, which will automatically time 30 seconds after opening on the computer, and then force the computer to shut down. You can only cancel after entering some specific characters. It was originally designed to copy the program to the system's startup folder after the first startup, so that the program will automatically run every time you boot up, but for some reason this only works on my computer :(?
